Tkinter card game written in repl.it.

I have 3 different card sizes, but as of May 8 2020 repl.it won't let you make Tk() windows larger than a certain size. So I had to stick with the smallest cards.

TODO: 
* Eliminate 2 global variables and somewhat-wasteful duplicate data structures
* Add GUI buttons to speed up/slow down pause after second card reveal
* add timer
* Save high scores
